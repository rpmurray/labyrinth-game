++ High Level Concept ++

-random hamiltonian cycle graphs form the basis for levels
-each vertex is a room in the labyrinth, each edge is a door/portal from one room to another
-each level requires the player to navigate the given rooms for that level in a hamiltonian cycle, and upon failing is teleported to the first room (or maybe a random room?)
-each level may have more than one correct path
-each room has an altar of sorts to activate, and once a cycle has all its altars activated a staircase/portal to the next level appears in the first room
-consideration: have a map that gets updated
